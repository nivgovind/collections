Given the syllabus for **DAMG 7370: Designing Advanced Data Architectures for Business Intelligence**, a senior graduate class project should challenge students to apply their knowledge of data architecture, integration, and visualization to real-world business intelligence scenarios. Here's a creative project idea that aligns with the course learning outcomes:

## Project Title: **Smart Retail Analytics Platform**

### Project Overview

Develop a comprehensive business intelligence platform for a retail company to enhance decision-making through data-driven insights. The platform should integrate data from various sources (e.g., sales, customer interactions, inventory management) and provide advanced analytics and visualizations to support strategic business decisions.

### Project Objectives

1. **Data Architecture Design**: Design an advanced data architecture that supports both structured and semi-structured data sources. This should include cloud-based solutions for scalability and on-premise components for sensitive data.
   
2. **Data Preparation and Integration**: Use data preparation and integration tools to gather, integrate, and load curated data from diverse retail systems (e.g., POS systems, CRM, inventory management software).

3. **BI Data Visualization and Reporting**: Develop effective BI data visualizations and reports to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory levels. Utilize technologies such as databases, hybrid data integrations, cloud integration, data preparation, and data virtualization.

### Project Components

- **Data Sources**:
  - Sales data from POS systems.
  - Customer interaction data from CRM systems.
  - Inventory levels from inventory management software.
  - Social media and customer feedback data for sentiment analysis.

- **Data Architecture**:
  - Design a cloud-based data warehouse (e.g., AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery) for storing integrated data.
  - Implement data pipelines using tools like Apache Beam or AWS Glue for ETL processes.
  - Ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations.

- **Data Visualization and Analytics**:
  - Use a visualization tool like Tableau or Power BI to create interactive dashboards.
  - Develop reports to analyze sales trends, customer segmentation, and inventory optimization.
  - Implement predictive analytics (e.g., forecasting sales using machine learning models) to guide future business strategies.

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Integrate machine learning models to predict customer churn or recommend products based on purchase history.
  - Develop a mobile app for real-time access to analytics and reports.

### Project Deliverables

1. **Written Report**: Document the design process, technical challenges faced, and solutions implemented.
2. **Presentation**: Present the project to the class, focusing on key features and insights gained.
3. **Functional Prototype**: Deploy the platform on a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) and demonstrate its functionality.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical Complexity**: Depth of data architecture design and integration complexity.
- **Analytical Insights**: Quality of analytics and visualizations provided.
- **Presentation and Report**: Clarity and professionalism of the written report and presentation.
- **Innovation**: Use of advanced technologies or innovative solutions to business intelligence challenges.
